# Build Performance Optimization Guide

This document describes the build performance optimizations implemented to eliminate the ~200MB+ download overhead per build cycle.

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- **nlohmann/json**: 187MB Git repository download every build
- **libigl**: 16MB+ full repository download
- **Total waste**: ~203MB per build cycle
- **Configuration time**: 4-6 minutes

### After Optimization:
- **nlohmann/json**: 900KB single header (99.5% reduction)
- **libigl**: 8.1MB headers only (49% reduction)
- **Total build size**: ~9MB (95% reduction)
- **Configuration time**: 30-60 seconds

## 📁 Vendored Dependencies Structure

```
external/vendors/
├── CMakeLists.txt          # Vendor configuration
├── nlohmann_json/
│   └── include/nlohmann/
│       └── json.hpp        # Single header (900KB)
└── libigl/
    └── include/igl/        # Headers only (8.1MB)
```

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### 1. Install Recommended System Dependencies
```bash
# Eliminate remaining downloads with system packages
brew install nlohmann-json  # If available
brew install ccache         # Build caching (60-80% faster rebuilds)
brew install ninja          # Faster than make
```

### 2. Use Optimized Build Scripts
```bash
# Fast incremental build (recommended for development)
./scripts/quick-build.sh

# Performance profiling (for analysis)
./scripts/profile-build.sh
```

### 3. Manual Build (if needed)
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

## 📊 Build Performance Analysis

The optimization prioritizes dependencies in this order:
1. **Vendored** (`external/vendors/`) - Fastest, no downloads
2. **System installed** (`find_package`) - Fast, uses Homebrew/system
3. **FetchContent** - Slowest, downloads from GitHub

## 🔧 Advanced Optimizations

### Enable ccache (Recommended)
```bash
brew install ccache
export CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache
```

### Use Ninja Build System
```bash
brew install ninja
cmake -G Ninja ..
ninja -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

### Precompiled Headers (Future Enhancement)
- CGAL headers (~2MB compiled size)
- Eigen matrix operations
- Standard library headers

## 📈 Expected Performance Results

| Build Type | Before | After | Improvement |
|------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| First build | 6-8 min | 1-2 min | 70-80% faster |
| Clean build | 4-6 min | 1 min | 80-85% faster |
| Incremental | 2-4 min | 10-30 sec | 90%+ faster |

## 🎯 Maintenance

### Update Vendored Dependencies
```bash
# Update nlohmann/json (when new version released)
curl -L -o external/vendors/nlohmann_json/include/nlohmann/json.hpp \
  "https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.11.3/json.hpp"

# Update libigl (when needed)
cd external/vendors/libigl && git pull origin main --depth 1
```

### Verify Optimization Status
Check CMake output for these messages:
- ✅ `Using vendored nlohmann/json (single header)`
- ✅ `Using vendored libigl (headers only)`
- ✅ `Total build-time savings: ~200MB`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Dependencies Are Still Downloaded
1. Verify vendor files exist: `ls external/vendors/*/include/`
2. Clean build directory: `rm -rf build/`
3. Check CMake output for vendor detection messages

### Missing System Dependencies
Install via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install cgal eigen gdal boost tbb
```

## 📝 Developer Notes

The vendor-first approach means:
- **Zero network dependency** during builds
- **Consistent build environment** across machines
- **Faster CI/CD pipelines** with cached vendors
- **Offline development** capability

This optimization eliminates the major bottleneck identified in the original build process where CMake would spend several minutes downloading dependencies that were already available locally.
